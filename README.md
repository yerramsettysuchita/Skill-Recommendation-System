### Skill Set Recommendation System
The **Skill Set Recommender System** is an open-source platform tailored to simplify the candidate recommendation process. It uses machine learning-inspired similarity algorithms to compare user-defined skill requirements with a dataset of candidates, generating ranked suggestions based on compatibility. Key features include:

- **Interactive User Interface**: Built with Bootstrap for responsive and intuitive interactions.
- **Backend Intelligence**: Powered by Flask, offering both web and API-based recommendations.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Employs Euclidean distance and Pearson correlation to ensure accurate matches.
- **Extensive Dataset**: Preloaded with diverse candidate profiles for robust testing and demonstrations.
